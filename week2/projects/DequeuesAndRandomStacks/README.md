#DequeuesAndRandomizedQueue

Here is my completed week 2 project for Princeton's Algorithms and Data Structures class.

The specifications for the assignment can be found here: http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues.html

Directions for testing and use of this program can be found in the comments of PermutationTester.

Permutation.java is a driver for the online code judge and is of little use for testing.
